However, it is important to note that communications made by you using our Services may put your Personal Information in the hands of third parties that we cannot control – for example, if you have previously made your Personal Information public via our Services. In some instances, we may not be able to delete your Personal Information and/or Shared Information from our Services or systems – in which case we will (where reasonably practicable) let you know why we are unable to do so.</div>
